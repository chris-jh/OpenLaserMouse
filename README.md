# Open Laser Mouse
 Quadrature Optical Mouse Replacement Using an Arduino for the Amiga Tank Mouse

![PCB](Photos/small.jpg)

Version 1.4.1
Copyright 2020 Chrissy

* Updated 3D Lens Cover

Version 1.4
Copyright 2020 Chrissy

* Added Atari ST SMD Version
  * Not Tested
  * Arduino is flipped 180Â° for ST version
  * Use same Amiga Pin definition in Arduino source if using original ST DE9 Connector.
* Fixed Wrong Fillplane selected. Corrected it back to GND.

Version 1.3
Copyright 2020 Chrissy

* ADNS9800 interface based on code from https://github.com/mrjohnk/ADNS-9800
* QUADRATURE interface based on blog from http://danceswithferrets.org/geekblog/?p=742

Two versions of the PCB, a SMD version (v1.1 Tested, not v1.3 yet) and a THT version which is currently untested.

Requires an Arduino Nano and a ADNS9800 Laser, which you can get still get from Aliexpress. Make sure to also get the Lens.

Gerbers have been created from the recommendations at JLCPCB.

You may need to re-generate for your chosen PCB Manufacturer

get the 1.2mm PCB Thickness or get smaller height tact switches if you use 1.6mm thickness. It is a tight tolerance between the tact switch mouse buttons and the posts on the mouse buttons.

## 3D Printable Lens Cover

3D Printable Lens Cover still requires testing, Sketchup model file is included to modify for tolerances of your printer.
<br>Only for Amiga SMD Version at the moment

## !!!!! WARNING !!!!!
Don't Plug in the USB to the Arduino while connected to the Amiga/Computer, as this will join the 5V together and may damage something.

This is still a work in progress, use at your own risk. I accept no responsibility if this damages any of your equipment.
